# Student-Dropout-Risk-Analysis
Use predictive analytics to identify students at risk of dropping out, leveraging academic, demographic and financial data to inform early interventions.

🧠 ML Project: From Data Exploration to Ensemble Modeling

This repository contains a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, divided across four Python scripts. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, regularization, ensemble learning, optimization, and model evaluation.
